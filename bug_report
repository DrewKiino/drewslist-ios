* Andrew
	1. camera permission is sometimes asked before onboarding view is shown
	2. delete user account does NOT delete user account
	3. listing a book in scanner view disables scanner
	4. Chat system is broken
	5. user should not be able to call other user if their call permission is disabled (both user profile and chat view)
