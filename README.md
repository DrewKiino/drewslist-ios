###Design Philosophy###

I want to instill a developer culture of constantly asking the question...
*'Is there a framework for this?'*

a prime example is Toucan's image library, which handles core image processing and doing features. Yet, all of that can be done in two lines of code using that framework :) gradually speeding up the development process without having to write native code for it. Another example is using Realm.io which handles persistent data for iOS apps. As you know, Core Data, apple's native persistent data solution sucks butt and is a headache to implement. Realm solves this easily. **Frameworks = Speed + Implementation**
